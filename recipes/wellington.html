        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, softened, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>2 ounces liver paté</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk, beaten</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place beef tenderloin in a baking dish. Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over beef.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
            <li>Mix paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.</li>
            <li>Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center.</li>
            <li>Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 122 to 130 degrees F (50 to 54 degrees C) for medium rare. Set aside to rest.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain and serve with beef.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
